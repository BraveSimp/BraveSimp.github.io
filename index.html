  <pre> Brave :
- Basic Attention Token (BAT) project
- IPFS integration (First browser that ever does this)
- Tor integration
- Built-in Rust ad-blocker (Not innovative but the best built-in ad-blocker on any browser I've tried)
- Privacy respecting news feed (I think Firefox had something similar, iirc it was called Pocket)
- Open source
- Ungoogled chromium

Opera:
- Integrated VPN (not that good as fair as I'm aware but it's something)
- Sidebar (Vivaldi has this too but not that many browsers do)
- Built in messenger apps on said sidebar
- Search through the tabs you have open
- Built-in ad-blocker (Haven't found it very good myself)

Firefox:
- Different browser engine
- Pocket, privacy respecting news feed (Not 100% sure it's integrated)
- Open source
- Built-in ad-blocker (Whitelists youtube.com by default for me, haven't found it to block ads very well)
- Very nice extension store
- Slightly worse screenshot tool than Edge
- Password creator

Edge:
- Collections (Quite useful sometimes)
- Good screenshot tool
- Fun(ish) and unique no internet game
- Coupon feature to save you money on some websites
- Price comparison
- Password creator
- Sidebar Search

Vivaldi:
- Best customisation of all browsers out there
- Best tab managment
- Amazing Sidebar with many features
- Shows tab content when you mouse over it for a bit
- Built in ad-blocker (Not really that good)
- Customisable gestures
- Built-in Mail client, Calendar and Feed reader

Chrome:
  - Enhanced tracking and privacy violation
